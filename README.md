# XcodeGen + SwiftUI Sample Template
Template repository for SwiftUI sample app with SPM generated by [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

### Requirements
- Xcode 15+.
- [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint#installing) installed.

## Generate a sample app

### 1. Update project name
Begin by updating the project name in the Makefile.  
- Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` with the desired name of your project.

```diff
-PROJECT_NAME := SampleApp
+PROJECT_NAME := YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```
- Replace `AppTemplate` name with the desired name of your app target.


### (Optional) Update project git directory path
If the sample app project is located in a different directory than the git directory,  
update the `PROJECT_GIT_DIR` variable in the Makefile to the relative path of the git directory.

```diff
-PROJECT_GIT_DIR := .
+PROJECT_GIT_DIR := ..
```

### 2. Generate the project
Run the following commands to generate the project for the sample app:

```bash
make bootstrap
make gen-project
make open-project
```
